        <h2 class="title">Update user password</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the horrible authentication plugins, updating user password, resetting password and creating new account may take up to
            5 mins for the game server to update
        </p>
        <p>
            Sorry for the inconvenience.

        <h2 class="title">New website!!!</h2>
        <p>
            From now on, in game registration is disabled. All new user must register a new account here. Current user must re-register
            a new account, all in game data is preserved except last login location (you will be sent back to spawn point). However, you can contact admin
            after create a new account here and ask for teleporting you back to your last location.
        </p>
        <p>
            New crash detection system is installed, hopefully it will work.
        </p>
